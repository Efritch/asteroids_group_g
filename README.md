This project will dive into which planets receive the most close approaches of asteroids, how many hit earth, and potential value of them.

Using data collected by NASA, we are going to analyze asteroids in our solar system. Our program will address the following questions.

1.	Do outer planets receive more close approaches than inner planets?
    Null: If the inner planets are similar to the outer planets, then the quantity of close approaches with the Inner planets will not be more or less than with the outer planets.
    Alt: If the inner planets are different from the outer planets, then the quantity of close approaches with the Inner planets will be more or less than the with outer planets.

2.  How many asteroids have impacted or had a potential impact with earth? (pending)
    Null: (pending review)
    Alt: (pending review)

3.  Do rare earth elements exist in significant quantities on asteroids near earth?
    Null: If an asteroid with rare earth elements are close to earth, then a measurable amount of rare earth elements will not be detected more or less observed.
    Alt: If and asteroid with rare earth elements are close to earth, then a measurable amount of rare earth elements more or less will be detected.
    
Our data for this project will be sourced from NASA’s public APIs.
•	Asteroids NeoWs
•	SSD/CNEOS
We will also be looking at asterlink.com for information related to near-earth objects.
