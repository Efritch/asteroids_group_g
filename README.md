This project will dive into which planets receive the most close approaches of asteroids, how many hit earth, and potential value of them.

Using data collected by NASA, we are going to analyze asteroids in our solar system. Our program will address the following questions.

1.	Are inner planets receiving more close approaches than they did 50 years ago?
    Null: If an inner planet's close approaches count recently is simular to the last few decades, then the quantity of close approaches recently will not be more or less than the quantity over the last few decades.
    Alt: If an inner planet's close approaches count recently is different from the last few decades, then the quantity of close approaches recently will be more or less than the quantity over the last few decades.

2.  How many asteroids have impacted or had a potential impact with earth? (pending)
    Null: (pending review)
    Alt: (pending review)

3.  Do rare earth elements exist in significant quantities on asteroids near earth?
    Null: If an asteroid with rare earth elements are close to earth, then a measurable amount of rare earth elements will not be detected more or less observed.
    Alt: If and asteroid with rare earth elements are close to earth, then a measurable amount of rare earth elements more or less will be detected.
    
Our data for this project will be sourced from NASA’s public APIs.
•	Asteroids NeoWs
•	SSD/CNEOS
We will also be looking at asterlink.com for information related to near-earth objects.
