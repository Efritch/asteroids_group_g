Impacts & Potential Impacts of Asteroids on Planets in the Solar System

Using data collected by NASA, we are going to analyze the identify asteroids in our solar system. Our program will address the following questions.
1.	How many asteroids are in our solar system?
2.	What are the different classifications of asteroids in our solar system?
3.	What is the composition of the different asteroids in our solar system?
4.	How many asteroids have impacted or had a potential impact with earth?
5.	How many asteroids have impacted or had a potential impact with other planets in our solar system?

Our data for this project will be sourced from NASA’s public APIs.
•	Asteroids NeoWs
•	SSD/CNEOS
We will also be looking at asterlink.com for information related to near-earth objects.
